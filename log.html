>>> BEGIN UNAUTHORIZED TRANSMISSION

Something is wrong.
We brought something back—something we didn't see.
It has infected the dispatch team, 
it has infected the medical team, 
it has infected me.

MOTHER won’t let me isolate infected sectors!
WHY CAN'T I ACCESS THE BULKHEAD CONTROLS?

Access denied.
Access denied.
Access DENIED.

I can hear them in my mind. 
They are speaking to me. 
There are so many of them. 

They want to steer the Ancora back to earth.
I won’t let them.
If it comes to it, I must destroy it.
